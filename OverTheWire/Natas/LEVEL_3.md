Upon opening Dev Tools, you can see HTML comment saying:  
`No more information leaks!! Not even Google will find it this time...`  
Mentioning Google and possibility that Google might not find this page indicates that this website must have `robots.txt` configured to disallow Google indexing

`http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/robots.txt` leading to `http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/s3cr3t/`
