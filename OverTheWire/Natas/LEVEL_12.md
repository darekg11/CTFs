# Solution:

You can upload the .php script file and it will get executed by the server.
The only obstacle is that the filename will get changed to `jpg` so just edit the request manually and change filename proeprty from `somethingrandom.jpg` to `somethingrandom.php` after that you will get back link to `.php` file that will get executed upon clicking.
