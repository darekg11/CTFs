# Solution

Downloaded file does not have extension, but if you open it, you can see:

```
challenge.pdf%PDF-1.5
```

So it is actually a PDF file so just add `.pdf` extension and open it up.  
After opening it up you can see that username and password blacked out.  
Upon double clicking on password blacked out box, flag will reveal.  
Flag jsut had black font color.
